# ethereumvoter
A simple decentralized application showing proof-of-concept of a voting system using Ethereum Smart Contracts

## Installing Dependencies :
In order to build our dApp, we need a few dependencies first.

* #### Node Package Manager (NPM) 
The first dependency we need is Node Package Manager, or NPM, which comes with Node.js. Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* #### Truffle Framework
The next dependency is the [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/), which allows us to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a suite of tools that allow us to write smart contacts with the Solidity programming language. It also enables us to test our smart contracts and deploy them to the blockchain. It also gives us a place to develop our client-side application.

You can install Truffle with NPM in your command line like this:
```npm install -g truffle```

* #### Ganache
The next dependency is Ganache, a local in-memory blockchain. You can install Ganache by [downloading it from the Truffle Framework website](http://truffleframework.com/ganache). It will give us 10 external accounts with addresses on our local Ethereum blockchain. Each account is preloaded with 100 fake ether.

* #### Metamask
Metamask
The next dependency is the [Metamask extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en). In order to use the blockchain, we must connect to it. We’ll have to install a special browser extension in order to use the Ethereum block chain. That’s where metamask comes in. We’ll be able to connect to our local Ethereum blockchain with our personal account, and interact with our smart contract.
